# JS Training - Chapters 1 to  7 js from babu

This project contains my progress through chapters 1 to 6 of JavaScript. It includes coding exercises and a functional calculator.

## Content of the files
- **index.html**: Website structure with a navigation menu and a calculator interface.
- **style.css**: Layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid, and management of active/hidden sections.
- **script.js**: Logic for the calculator, tab switching, and JavaScript exercises (commented out).

## Skills acquired (Chapters 1-6)
- **Basics**: Variables, constants, and data types (String, Number, Boolean).
- **Data Structures**: Creating and manipulating simple and multi-dimensional arrays (push, splice, concat) and objects.
- **Logic**: Using if/else conditions and for/while loops (including multiplication tables).
- **Functions**: Creating functions with parameters and return values.
- **DOM**: Managing click events and updating the HTML interface dynamically.

## Main features
- Navigation between "Home", "About", and "Calculator" without reloading the page.
- A calculator that processes additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions.
- Console-based exercises on complex objects and arrays.

## New exercise: Inventory Management (Chapter 7 - Classes)

I added a stock section to practice Classes 
Key points:

   - **Classes**: Created ordinateurs model with a constructor for model, version, color, RAM, and storage.

   -**Dynamic**: The addcomputer() function:

        Gets data via prompt.

        Creates a new object from the class.

        Saves it in the arrayordinateurs array.

    -**Console**: Uses console.table() to show the stock clearly.

How to test:

Run addcomputer() in the console, fill the info, and see the stock update.
